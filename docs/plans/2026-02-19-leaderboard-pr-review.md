## Review Checklist

### 1. Plan Completeness
- [ ] Verify all 11 plan tasks are addressed (Task 11 is manual E2E testing — not code)
- [ ] Check that Arena Rankings tab (Task 10) includes: ArenaView type update, state, useEffect, tab button, rankings view content, "View All Leaderboards" navigation link
- [ ] Confirm no plan tasks were skipped or partially implemented

### 2. Architecture & Design Alignment
- [ ] Redis ZSET pattern matches design doc (key: `leaderboard:{category}`, meta hash: `leaderboard:meta:{category}`)
- [ ] 22+ ranking categories implemented across 4 groups: PvP (4), Progression (3), Skills (14+), Combat (2)
- [ ] `refreshAllLeaderboards()` called on startup + setInterval at REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS (900,000ms = 15min)
- [ ] `optionalAuthenticate` correctly attaches player if token valid, proceeds without if not
- [ ] `getLeaderboard` supports `around_me` query param for centered-on-player view

### 3. Type Safety
- [ ] No `any` types introduced
- [ ] Frontend `LeaderboardEntry` / `LeaderboardResponse` types match API service interfaces
- [ ] `Screen` union type includes `'leaderboard'`
- [ ] `ArenaView` union type includes `'rankings'`

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Service follows existing patterns (Prisma queries, error handling with try/catch per category)
- [ ] Route follows existing patterns (Router, middleware, async handler with next(err))
- [ ] Frontend components follow existing patterns (PixelCard, RPG CSS variables, tab styling)
- [ ] No duplicated logic between LeaderboardTable usage in Leaderboard screen vs ArenaScreen
- [ ] `formatScore` handles large numbers readably (K/M suffixes)
- [ ] `timeSince` provides human-readable refresh timestamps

### 5. Edge Cases & Robustness
- [ ] Invalid category slug returns error (VALID_SLUGS set check)
- [ ] Empty leaderboard renders "No rankings available yet" state
- [ ] Loading state renders correctly
- [ ] BossParticipant query wrapped in try/catch (model may not exist)
- [ ] Redis operations handle empty ZSET gracefully (zcard returns 0, zrevrange returns [])
- [ ] Meta hash missing entries fall back to `{ username: 'Unknown', characterLevel: 1, isBot: false }`

### 6. Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries in refresh logic (batch Prisma queries, single ZADD per category)
- [ ] Meta hashes use HGET per entry during read — acceptable for PAGE_SIZE=25, but review if this could be HMGET batch
- [ ] Redis DEL before ZADD is non-atomic — brief window of empty data during refresh. Acceptable for dev; note if concerning for prod

### 7. Security
- [ ] Leaderboard routes use `optionalAuthenticate` (not `authenticate`) — public access is intentional
- [ ] No player-sensitive data exposed (only username, characterLevel, score, isBot, rank)
- [ ] Category slug validated against allowlist before Redis key construction (no injection risk)

### 8. UI/UX
- [ ] Top 3 ranks get medal icons (gold, silver, bronze)
- [ ] Current player row highlighted with gold border
- [ ] Bot players show Bot icon
- [ ] "View My Rank" toggles between top-N and around-me views
- [ ] Pinned rank bar appears when player not visible in current view
- [ ] Group tabs match existing app tab styling
- [ ] Category dropdown only shown when group has >1 category
- [ ] Arena Rankings tab includes navigation link to full Leaderboard screen

### 9. Missing or Deferred
- [ ] No unit tests for leaderboardService (plan didn't include test task — flag if needed)
- [ ] No pagination beyond PAGE_SIZE=25 (design intentionally shows top 25 or around-me window)
- [ ] No WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates (by design — snapshot-based)
